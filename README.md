The dataset used is Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Dataset

Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Dataset include the vibration dataset recorded by using SpectraQuestâ€™s Gearbox Fault Diagnostics Simulator.
Dataset has been recorded using 4 vibration sensors placed in four different direction, and under variation of load from '0' to '90' percent. Two different scenario are included:
1) Healthy condition and
2) Broken Tooth Condition
There are 20 files in total, 10 for healthy gearbox and 10 from broken one. Each file corresponds to a given load from 0% to 90% in steps of 10%.

The filename structure is indicative of the contents of the file:

First character being "h" for the healthy gearbox, "b" for the gearbox with the broken tooth
Last 1-2 characters being the gearbox load (0-90) during the measurement
Between those pieces of information, each filename has the characters "30hz".
